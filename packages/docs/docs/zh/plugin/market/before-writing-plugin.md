# What you should know before creating a plugin

<Bit />

First thank's for think about help us to improve this awesome community !

If you want to want to create a plugin you may want to know how vuepress is working with [Plugins](/plugin/)

You should considering to respect that checklist:

- Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/pulls).
- Adding a description that explaining what your plugins will do.
- Wait for validation from the team.
- Create a .md inside @packages/docs/plugin/market/community folder. It should respect your-plugin-name.md.
- Copy the same md into @packages/docs/zh/plugin/market/community folder.
- It should have :
  - a description
  - the link of the github repository
  - how to install it
  - how to use it
  - how to run tests

- You should add the corresponding nav into.


Of course we will follow you during the process and will answer to your questions in your pull request
